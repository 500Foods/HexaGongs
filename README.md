# HexaGongs
This started life as a TMS WEB Core project created for the TMS Software Blog, starting with [this post](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=1106). Some of the topics covered include the following.

1. Using the Web Audio API in different ways.
2. Designing a bespoke UI, where virtually everything is hexagon-based (no rounded corners!).
3. Incorporate content from as many of the other recent blog posts as possible.
4. Another example of using XData in a TMS WEB Core project (see related [HexaGongsX](https://github.com/500Foods/HexaGongsX) repository).

The result is a fun little app where you can layout a sound board of sorts - add new "hexagong" tiles for each sound clip, and then you can just tap on them to play the sound. Useful for a variety of applications, but intended mostly as a demonstration project.

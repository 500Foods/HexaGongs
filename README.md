# HexaGongs
This started life as a TMS WEB Core project created for the TMS Software Blog, starting with [this post](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=1106). Some of the topics covered include the following.

1. Customizing UI elements so that they are *all* hexagon-based.
2. Using the Web Audio API to play audio clips coming from user-supplied sources.
3. Designing a custom color picker.
4. Designing a custom image picker.
5. An array of CSS animations.
6. Using XData in a TMS WEB Core project (see related [HexaGongsX](https://github.com/500Foods/HexaGongsX) repository).
7. Deployment considerations.

The result is a fun little app where you can create a custom sound board of sorts - add new "hexagong" tiles for each sound clip, and then you can just tap on them to play the sound. Useful for a variety of applications, but intended mostly as a demonstration project.
